                    Education in Bangladesh is overseen by the country's Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Primary and Mass Education is 
                    responsible for implementing policy for primary education and state-funded schools at a local level. In Bangladesh, all 
                    citizens must undertake twelve years of compulsory education which consists of eight years at primary school level and four 
                    years at high school level. Primary and secondary education is financed by the state and free of charge in public schools.

                    Bangladesh conforms fully to the UN's Education For All (EFA) objectives[3] and the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)[4] 
                    as well as other education-related international declarations. Article 17 of the Bangladesh Constitution provides that all 
                    children receive free and compulsory education

                    "In Bangladesh, people with disabilities have insufficient opportunities to be included in mainstream education, economy 
                     and society. They don't receive early intervention and proper planning to combat against their disabilities. Their 
                     potentialities and hidden skills are not being discovered by institutions or any experts. That's why near about one tenth 
                     of the total population are at risk of economic exclusion," explains Urmi Saha, Coordinator, MWS. Here, experts have been 
                     trying their best to find out the nature of disabilities to offer early intervention, positive parenting and strategic way 
                     of individualised education, to discover potentialities and to train children for economic and social inclusion.

                <p class="sectionSubTag">
                    Bangladesh has done an excellent job of increasing literacy, especially at the primary level. However, a major issue  in 
                    Bangladesh is lack of quality education for many public schools. Overcrowding and under qualified instructors have led to 
                    high dropout rates at the primary and secondary levels. While primary enrollment is at 98%, it drops substantially to 22% 
                    at the higher secondary level. This is especially evident in rural communities where various social and economic factors 
                    can prevent safe access to education – for example: natural disasters, child labor, family poverty, disability, gender abuse, 
                    child marriage, and poor sanitation.

                    Currently, the government’s main goals are to expand learning opportunities at earlier ages, offer more inclusive education, 
                    and provide increased access to education for adolescents. Learn more here.
